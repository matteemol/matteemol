- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @matteemol


I studied chemistry in the university, also worked as a chemist in the pharma industry for some time ( i > 10y), and loved chemistry since the beginning (who didn't have a chemistry kit as a kid??)

Now, I'm taking a life spin off: starting a journey as a dev, taking my first steps in programming and collaboration in actual, useful proyects.

You can reach me out in twitter @matteemol by the time being.

Thanks for taking some time to readME!
